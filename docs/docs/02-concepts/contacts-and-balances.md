# Contacts and their balances

A contact is a person or a business that you work with. Akaun uses contacts to show who owes
money, and to whom. This page tells how Akaun calculates the balance of each contact.

## What a contact is

Each contact has an entity type: **Individual** or **Business**.

A contact can also have one or more roles. The roles are **Customer**, **Supplier**, **Employee**
and **Partner**. For example, a business that buys from you and also sells to you is a customer
and a supplier. A contact can also have no role.

A record can name one contact. A payment to several contacts names a contact on each allocation.

## When a record must name a contact

A record that uses **Accounts Payable** or **Accounts Receivable** must name a contact. These two
accounts hold the money that is owed. The contact tells who owes the money, or to whom it is owed.
On such a record, the **Contact** field shows a star (*), and you cannot save the record without
a contact.

On all other records, the contact is optional.

## How Akaun calculates a balance

Akaun does not keep a separate account for each contact. It calculates the balance of a contact
from the records that name the contact:

- The money that the contact owes you comes from records on **Accounts Receivable** that are not
  paid yet.
- The money that you owe the contact comes from records on **Accounts Payable** that are not paid
  yet.

Payments reduce the balance. You cannot type a balance. Thus the balance of a contact always
agrees with the records.

For example, a customer gets an invoice of 500.00 and pays 200.00. The balance of the customer is
300.00 owed to you.

If a contact owes you money and you also owe the contact money, Akaun shows the difference as one
balance.

## Where you see the balance

- The **Contacts** screen has a **Balance** column. Each balance shows **owed to you** or
  **you owe**. A dash (—) shows that nothing is outstanding.
- If something is outstanding, the **Contacts** screen shows two totals under its title:
  **you owe** and **owed to you**.
- The page of a contact shows the balance at the top. The text beside it is **still owed to you**,
  **you still owe them** or **nothing outstanding either way**.
- On the page of a contact, **See everything with this contact** opens the **Records** screen with
  only the records of this contact.

You see balances only if you have the permission to see records.
