# Cash Flow Statement

The **Cash Flow Statement** tells you where your cash came from and what the business spent it on in a period. A
business can make a profit and still have less cash. This report shows why.

:::info

You need the **View** permission on **Reports**. Reports are view only. See
[Permissions explained](../09-administration/permissions-explained.md).

:::

## Open the report

1. Click **Reports**.
2. Click the **Cash Flow Statement** tab.
3. In **From**, choose the first day of the period.
4. In **To**, choose the last day of the period.

At the start, the period is from 1 January of this year to today.

## What counts as cash

Cash is the money in Asset accounts with the sub-type **Cash**, **Bank**, **Wallet** or
**Prepaid/debit card**. A transfer between two of these accounts does not change the cash. Thus it
is not on this report. See [Accounts and categories](../02-concepts/accounts-and-categories.md).

## What the report shows

The top of the report shows **Net change in cash** for the period. Below it, Akaun shows the cash at
the start of the period plus the change. The result must be equal to the cash at the end.

If **From** is after **To**, Akaun uses the **To** date for both.

The report has three sections. Each section ends with **Total**.

- **Operating activities**: the cash from the daily work of the business.
- **Investing activities**: the cash for things that the business keeps.
- **Financing activities**: the cash from loans and from the owners.

## How the sub-type selects the line

Each line is the total of a group of accounts. The account type and the sub-type select the line:

| Section | Line | Accounts |
|---|---|---|
| **Operating activities** | **Revenue** | Revenue accounts |
| **Operating activities** | **Change in receivables** | **Accounts receivable** |
| **Operating activities** | **Change in inventory** | **Inventory** |
| **Operating activities** | **Change in other current assets** | Other current Asset sub-types, for example **Prepayments and deposits** |
| **Operating activities** | **Trade payables and other liabilities** | Current Liability sub-types, for example **Accounts payable** and **Credit card** |
| **Operating activities** | **Cost of goods sold** | **Cost of goods sold** |
| **Operating activities** | **Operating expenses** | **Operating expense**, or no sub-type |
| **Operating activities** | **Other operating expenses** | **Other expense** |
| **Investing activities** | **Capital expenditure** | **Fixed asset**, **Intangible asset**, **Other non-current asset** |
| **Financing activities** | **Long-term debt** | **Long-term loan**, **Other non-current liability** |
| **Financing activities** | **Owner's equity** | Equity accounts |

The report shows only the lines with an amount in the period. If a section is empty, it shows
"Nothing this period."

### Needs review

An Asset or Liability account without a sub-type does not go into a section. Its amount shows in a
separate **Needs review** box, on the line **Not yet classified**. A note below the report also
tells you about it.

To give an account a sub-type, you need the **Change** permission on **Accounts**.

1. Click **Accounts**.
2. Click the account.
3. Make sure that the top of the account page shows **Needs review**.
4. In **Sub-type**, choose the correct sub-type.
5. Click **Save changes**.

The report then puts the amount on the correct line. In a new book, **Marketplace Clearing** and
**Loans** have no sub-type.

## Signs

A positive number is cash that the business received. A negative number is cash that the business paid. For example, the
expenses that you paid show as a negative number.

## Example

In April, the business had 5,000.00 in **Bank** at the start. Customers paid 9,000.00 for sales.
The business paid 3,000.00 for expenses and 2,000.00 for a laptop. The owner gave 1,000.00 more to the business.

| Section | Line | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| **Operating activities** | **Revenue** | 9,000.00 |
| **Operating activities** | **Operating expenses** | -3,000.00 |
| **Operating activities** | **Total** | 6,000.00 |
| **Investing activities** | **Capital expenditure** | -2,000.00 |
| **Investing activities** | **Total** | -2,000.00 |
| **Financing activities** | **Owner's equity** | 1,000.00 |
| **Financing activities** | **Total** | 1,000.00 |

The **Net change in cash** is 6,000.00 - 2,000.00 + 1,000.00 = 5,000.00. The cash at the end is
5,000.00 + 5,000.00 = 10,000.00.

## If the figures do not agree

If the change does not explain the cash at the end, the **Net change in cash** figure shows in
red. The text below it gives the difference. A warning also shows below the report. This tells you
that the data of a record is damaged.

1. Click **Settings**.
2. Click the **Books** tab.
3. In **Ledger integrity check**, click **Check now**.
4. Give the result to your administrator.

## See the records behind a line

You cannot click a line on this report, because each line can include many accounts. To see the
records, use the **Records** screen. Filter it by one cash account and by the dates of the report.
See [Find records](../03-everyday-tasks/find-records.md).

## Export the report

1. Click **Export**.

Akaun downloads a CSV file. The file has the columns "Section", "Account" and "Amount". It has the
lines and the "Total" of each section. If an amount needs review, the file has a "Needs review" row.
At the end, it has three "Cash" rows: the cash at the start, the net change and the cash at the end.
Below the table, the file gives the period and the notes of the report.

## Notes

- You cannot print a report at this time. Use **Export** and print the CSV file.
- The address of the report includes the dates. Copy the address to send the same report to a
  different user.
- If Akaun converted your book from an earlier version, a note can show below the report. It
  shows when the period starts before the conversion. Invoices from before that day are not in
  the figures.
