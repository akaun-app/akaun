# Settings reference

This page tells what each setting in **Settings** does, tab by tab. To prepare a new book in the
correct order, use [Prepare your book](../01-getting-started/set-up-your-book.md).

To open the settings, click **Settings** in the sidebar. The tabs are **General**, **Company**,
**Books**, **Intelligence**, **Templates** and **Advanced**.

:::info

**Settings** has no permission. All users who can sign in can open it and change most settings.
On the **Groups** tab in **Users & Groups**, the text for a superuser group says that settings are
for superusers only. This is not correct at this time. See [Permissions explained](./permissions-explained.md#settings).

## Save your changes

Each part of a tab has its own **Save** button. On the **Books** tab, the button is
**Save defaults**. Click the button of the part that you changed before you go to a different
part. After a save, Akaun shows **Settings saved**.

If you have unsaved changes and you click a different tab or a different screen, Akaun shows
**Unsaved changes**:

- Click **Keep editing** to stay and save your changes.
- Click **Discard changes** to remove your changes and continue.

A reload of the page, or a closed browser tab, removes unsaved changes without a message. The
**Unsaved changes** message also does not cover the **Default accounts** lists on the **Books** tab.

## General

The **General** tab has two parts: **Display** and **Numbering**.

### Display

- **Currency**: the main currency of the book. All amounts show in this currency. Akaun changes
  the amounts of foreign records into it.
- **Money usually comes from**: the account that new expenses and income use first. You can still
  change the account on each record. This row shows only when the book has two or more money
  accounts. At this time, a change in this row is not kept. To change this account, use
  **Default transaction account** on the **Books** tab.
- **Chart of Accounts**: click **Open accounts →** to open the **Accounts** screen.

Click **Save** under these rows to save **Currency**.

:::caution

**Currency** locks when the first record, quotation or invoice exists. A starting balance is also
a record. After the lock, **Currency** shows a lock icon and you cannot change it.

:::

See [Foreign currency](../02-concepts/foreign-currency.md).

### Numbering

**Numbering** sets one number format for expenses, income, payments, quotations and invoices.
Click a token, or drag it, to add it to the format: **PREFIX**, **YYYY**, **YY**, **MM**, **DD**
and **SEQ**. Type other characters, for example a dash, directly in the format. The **Preview**
line shows an example number. Click **Save** under **Numbering**.

[Prepare your book](../01-getting-started/set-up-your-book.md#3-choose-the-document-numbers) tells
what each token means.

The help text lists the codes EX, IN, CL, QT and IV, but it does not tell what CL is. CL is the
code for a payment.

:::caution

The number format locks when the first record, quotation or invoice exists. After the lock, the
tokens and the **Save** button do not show, and you cannot change the format.

:::

## Company

Akaun shows these details on printed quotations and invoices.

- **Logo**: click **Upload** to add a JPEG or PNG image of 5 MB or smaller. Click **Replace** to
  use a different image, or **Remove** to remove it.
- **Company Name**: the name of the business.
- **Address**: the address of the business.
- **Registration No.**: the registration number of the business.

Click **Save** to save the four fields.

## Books

:::info

The **Books** tab shows only for a user with the **View** permission on **Reports**.

:::

### Default accounts

Akaun uses these accounts for the automatic side of some records. Each list shows only the
accounts that fit the default.

| Default | What Akaun uses it for |
|---|---|
| **Accounts receivable** | An invoice that you send, and a payment from a customer. |
| **Accounts payable** | An expense that a different person pays for the business. |
| **Opening balances** | The other side of each starting balance. |
| **Sales revenue** | An invoice that does not choose a different revenue account. |
| **Uncategorised expense** | An imported expense with no matching expense account. |
| **Default transaction account** | The account that new expenses and income use first. **Money usually comes from** on the **General** tab shows this account. |
| **Uncategorised income** | An imported income with no matching revenue account. |

Click **Save defaults** to save. Akaun shows **Default accounts updated**. To change a default,
you need the **Change** permission on **Accounts**. Without it, the lists and the button are
not available.

See [Prepare your book](../01-getting-started/set-up-your-book.md#6-check-the-default-accounts).

### Ledger integrity check

The check adds the lines of each record and makes sure that each record balances. It only reads
the book. It changes nothing.

1. On the **Books** tab, find **Ledger integrity check**.
2. Click **Check now**.

If all records balance, Akaun shows **All good. Every record balances, and so does everything
added up together.** If a record does not balance, Akaun shows the record number and the
difference. Report this problem. See [Troubleshooting](../10-help/troubleshooting.md).

### Migration results

**Migration results** shows only after Akaun converted a book from an older version. It shows only
when the conversion had to make decisions without you. Each part lists the records that the
conversion changed, for example **Uncategorised records** or **Files that could not be found**.
Check each record in the list.

One message in this part names the folder `data/backups`. This is not correct. Akaun keeps the
previous files in a `pre-chart-` folder next to the database. See
[Backups and upgrades](./backups-and-upgrades.md#what-happens-at-the-first-start).

## Intelligence

The **Intelligence** tab controls **Auto Import**. It has three parts. **Providers** holds the AI
providers that read your documents. **Import profiles** holds the saved ways to read one kind of
document. **Processing** controls how Akaun processes the files. Click **Save** at the bottom of
the tab to save the changes on this tab. **Import profiles** shows only for a user with the
**View** permission on **Auto Import**.

See [Connect an AI provider](../04-auto-import/connect-an-ai-provider.md) and
[Import profiles](../04-auto-import/import-profiles.md).

## Templates

The **Templates** tab controls printed quotations and invoices.

- **Layout**: shows **Standard**. At this time, Akaun has one layout only, and you cannot change
  it.
- **Accent color**: the color of the printed documents. Choose a preset color, or choose a
  different color.

Click **Save** to save the color.

## Advanced

The **Advanced** tab has **Search index**. The search index is the text that the search box on
each list uses.

1. On the **Advanced** tab, find **Rebuild search index**.
2. Click **Rebuild**.

Akaun reads the stored files again. Then it makes the search text again for all records,
quotations, invoices and contacts. The row shows the progress. At the end, it shows the number of
records. Use this when the search does not find a record that it must find.

## Notes and limits

- Each setting applies to the full book and to all users.
- Your name, your password and the order of your screens are on your profile, not in
  **Settings**. See [Your profile](./your-profile.md).
