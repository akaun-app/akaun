// POST moved to `/api/accounts/[id]/reconciliation/statements`: a statement
// belongs to one account, and reconciling is reached from that account, so the
// account comes from the path rather than from a field the user had to fill in
// twice (FR-050, contracts/api.md).
//
// GET stays. Every other reconciliation endpoint is unchanged, including
// `PATCH /statements/[statementId]`, the move-to-another-account action that
// makes FR-054 reachable.
