 * This is the account-history report at a new address and under a new ability.
 * **Nothing about the arithmetic is rebuilt** — `accountHistory()`, the running
 * balance, the truncation note and the CSV writer are reused exactly as they
 * stand, and `AccountHistoryReport` is returned unchanged (FR-040–FR-046,
 * research.md R-07).
 *
 * What changes is who may read it. The old page shell was gated on
 * `accounts.view` while its data came from an endpoint gated on `reports.view`,
 * so one screen answered to two abilities and the shell could open on data it
 * was then refused. A statement is a way of reading records, so it is gated on
 * **`records.view`** — one screen, one ability (FR-046).
 *
 * A record touching the narrowed account twice appears once per side, which is
 * what makes the running balance add up (FR-042).
