/**
 * Uploading a statement for one account.
 *
 * The account comes from the **path**, not from a field in the form. A
 * statement always belonged to exactly one account — without knowing which,
 * there is no way to know which movements its lines could be, which is how
 * money sitting in a wallet once ended up offered against a bank statement —
 * and reconciling now starts from the account it belongs to, so the answer is
 * already in the address (FR-048, FR-050).
 *
 * That removes a question the user had to answer twice, and with it the `400`
 * "Choose the account this statement belongs to" refusal: an address cannot
 * fail to name an account.
 *
 * Everything else is unchanged and deliberately so (FR-057): the same
 * `reconciliation` ability, the same Zod boundary, the same size and type
 * checks, the same `createStatement` (whose money-holding validation still
 * runs), the same audit entry and the same event.
