/**
 * "Read again" (006 FR-023, US9 AS6-7): reads the document once more from
 * the file already uploaded, as `readAs` now names it, and replaces what the
 * last reading proposed. `readAs` takes the words an upload's "Read as" takes:
 * `auto`, `receipt`, `items` or `profile:<id>`. A profile is read in its own
 * import mode (FR-023), so there is no other choice; an `importMode` field
 * an older screen still sends is dropped unread.
 *
 * It needs two permissions. Reading a document needs the upload permission
 * and nothing more (FR-045), so `import.add`. It also throws away the items
 * or the card waiting for review and queues the job again, which is a change
 * to a job, as skipping one is, so `import.change` too. No new permission.
 *
 * Replies 202 once the job is queued again; the worker reads it, and every
 * open screen follows it through the live updates. A job that may not be read
 * again now (an item is confirmed, it is still being read, it is imported)
 * is refused with 409 and the reason, which the job's live update also
 * carries as `readAgainReason`.
