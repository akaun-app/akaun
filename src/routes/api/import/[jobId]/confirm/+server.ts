/**
 * Turning a reviewed document into a record.
 *
 * Every field the reviewer corrected arrives here as an override; anything they
 * left alone keeps what was read off the document. The result is one ledger
 * record with the account that paid or received it on one side and the category
 * on the other — the same shape the expenses and income screens write.
 *
 * This route reads and checks the request. `confirmReviewed` settles the fields
 * (looking up an exchange rate when one is missing, which can take a moment) and
 * then does every write in one transaction. An item of a group is confirmed by
 * the same function, from `items/[itemId]/confirm`.
 *
 * `readAt` is the reading the reviewer saw: the job's `processedAt` as their
 * screen had it. "Read again" can replace the reading while the card is open
 * (FR-023), and the reviewer's corrections were made to the old one, so a
 * confirm that names another reading is refused and makes no record
 * (FR-044). Left out, the reading in review now is confirmed.
