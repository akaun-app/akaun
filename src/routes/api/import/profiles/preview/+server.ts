/**
 * A preview of how the profile being edited reads a sample spreadsheet from
 * its columns (006 FR-053 to FR-055): the headings found, the first rows as
 * items, the count of each section and any reason the reading would fail.
 *
 * It is part of editing a profile, so it needs `import.change`, as saving one
 * does (FR-045). It **stores nothing**: the sample is read from the request
 * and dropped, the profile is never saved, and no queue row, file or audit
 * entry is made. The only read of the database is the main currency, which
 * an amount written in another currency's code is checked against, as an
 * upload is.
 *
 * The body is a form: `file` (an `.xlsx` or `.csv`) and `profile` (the
 * editor's payload, as JSON). The sample is read in the profile's own import
 * mode; a `mode` field an older editor still sends is not read.
