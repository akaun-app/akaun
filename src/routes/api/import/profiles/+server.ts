/**
 * Import profiles (006 US6, FR-030): list them, and add one.
 *
 * Listing needs `import.view`, the permission the upload screen already needs,
 * since "Read as" names the enabled profiles. Adding one is managing profiles,
 * which needs `import.change` (FR-045). The Settings loader has no permission
 * check of its own, so this route is where the rule is kept.
 *
 * The body of a POST is the profile's form, as the editor stages it. Zod only
 * checks that it is an object; what a profile may hold is checked by the one
 * shared check the editor also runs (`$lib/import-profile-schema.ts`), inside
 * the service, so the client and the server can never disagree about it. A
 * profile that breaks a rule is refused with every problem and its path, and
 * nothing is saved (FR-035 AS8).
