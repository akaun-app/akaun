/**
 * The dashboard shows totals rather than rows, so it does not need to know what
 * changed — only that something did. Every frame is the same "data-changed"
 * signal and the page re-fetches its figures.
 *
 * One emitter now covers every kind of record (`ledgerEvents`), which is the
 * point of having one: a dashboard figure that moved because of a transfer or a
 * settlement is just as stale as one that moved because of an expense, and with
 * three emitters it was possible to forget one silently (D-21).
