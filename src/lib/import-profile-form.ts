/**
 * The import profile editor's form, and how it turns into a profile and back
 * (006 US6, FR-030, FR-031, FR-035).
 *
 * The editor stages the whole profile in this shape and sends it once, as the
 * Settings page does. It differs from a saved profile in four ways:
 *
 * - Each section and line type carries a `uid`, so a list that is reordered or
 *   shortened keeps each row's own inputs.
 * - A new section's key follows its name (`keyFromName`). A saved section
 *   keeps the key it was saved with, so renaming it changes only what the
 *   screens show.
 * - "Advanced: extra fields" is the JSON text the user typed, not the parsed
 *   fragment. The shared check (`import-profile-schema.ts`) reads text and
 *   reports a typing mistake with its path, so the editor never parses it on
 *   its own and the server sees exactly what was typed.
 * - The table layout and row rules (FR-053, FR-054) hold every list as text,
 *   one entry per line, and every optional value as "" for none, so each
 *   field binds to an input as it is. `payloadFromForm` turns them into the
 *   layout the shared check reads, and a saved layout comes back through the
 *   form unchanged.
 * - Each section says how it is read, from the table's rows or by the AI
 *   (`readBy`, FR-057), and keeps its row rules while it is read by the AI,
 *   so switching back loses nothing. Only what the chosen way uses is sent.
 *
 * Pure TypeScript with no server imports, so the editor and the server specs
 * read the same rules.
