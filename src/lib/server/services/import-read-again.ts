/**
 * "Read again": reads a document once more from the file already uploaded,

 * (006 FR-023, US9 AS6-7).
 *
 * Nothing is read here. The job is put back in the queue as if it had just
 * been uploaded with the new choice, and the worker reads it as it reads any
 * upload: Auto-detect, the receipt reading, several items or a saved profile.
 * The file stays where it is, and so does any text that came with the upload
 * or that OCR read from an image, so the slow part of reading is not done
 * twice (see `keepsReadText` and `documentText`).

 * the new choice is stored, and the job is queued again. The worker then
