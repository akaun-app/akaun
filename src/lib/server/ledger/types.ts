/**
 * The ledger's shared vocabulary: every row shape, every DTO, and the argument
 * and result types that fix the signature of each function in
 * `src/lib/server/ledger/**` and `src/lib/server/queries/{ledger,accounts,
 * settlements,reports}.ts`.
 *
 * This file is the interface freeze. It exists so a rule module, a query, a
 * service and a page component can be written at the same time without
 * inventing each other's shapes. It holds no logic and no bodies — changing a
 * type here is a change every one of those callers sees, so it is a broadcast
 * rather than a quiet edit.
 *
 * Money: a `Minor` is whole cents of the MAIN currency, signed. A movement's
 * amount is positive when value goes INTO that account and negative when it
 * leaves, and a record's movements always add up to zero. The decimal `amount`
 * on a record is the figure as the user typed it, in the record's own
 * `currency` — it is for display and audit and is never summed for a report.
 *
 * See specs/002-double-entry-ledger/data-model.md.
