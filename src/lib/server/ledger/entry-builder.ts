/**
 * The single place a record's sides are constructed.
 *
 * Every screen describes what happened in its own everyday terms — "an expense
 * someone else paid", "a withdrawal from the Shopee wallet" — and one function
 * per kind turns that into the two or more movements that say where the money
 * came from and where it went. Because this is the only writer, the balance
 * rule (FR-002) and the "say who it is owed to" rule (FR-008) have exactly one
 * enforcement point, and `integrity.ts` sweeps for the same invariants after
 * the fact.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. A rule that refuses returns the plain sentence the user
 * is shown, which is what the API sends as a `409`'s `reason`.
