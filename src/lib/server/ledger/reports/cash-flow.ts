/**
 * Where the period's cash came from and what it went on (FR-006, FR-010).
 *
 * Pure: the rows arrive already narrowed by `queries/reports.ts`, so this
 * module never sees a date on a movement and never touches a database — the
 * same split every other report module keeps.
 *
 * **`rows` is every side that is not itself cash-and-cash-equivalent, from
 * every record that touches a "fund" account** — cash-and-equivalent
 * (FR-006) or a needs-review Asset account (subType `null`), because until an
 * account is classified there is no way to know which side of that line it
 * belongs on. `queries/reports.ts` selects this the same way
 * `fundsFlowStatement` selects its rows, substituting the fund predicate for
 * the current-asset one.
 *
 * A needs-review Asset account's own movement is one of these rows too — it
 * is not cash-and-equivalent, so it is not excluded — but it is deliberately
 * routed to `needsReviewMinor` instead of a section (FR-005), never folded
 * into Operating by default. `input.needsReviewMinor` carries that
 * contribution, read independently by `queries/reports.ts` — safe to do
 * because `IS_FUND_ACCOUNT` already admits every needs-review Asset by
 * definition, so its whole-ledger total and its `rows`-scoped total are the
 * same number.
 *
 * A needs-review **Liability**'s movement does not have that guarantee — most
 * Liability activity never touches a fund account at all (an accrual against
 * an expense, say), so sweeping every needs-review Liability total in
 * unconditionally would count movements that were never going to appear on
 * this statement anyway. `cashFlow` below instead adds up the Liability rows
 * `lineFor` returns `null` for — which, being in `rows`, are already scoped to
 * records that touched a fund account — and folds that into `needsReviewMinor`
 * itself, rather than asking `queries/reports.ts` for a second independent
 * total the way it does for Asset.
 *
 * Why `ties` is a real check and not a restatement of the arithmetic above it:
 * every record's movements sum to zero, so for the whole ledger,
 * `Σ(cash-and-equivalent sides) + Σ(needs-review sides) + Σ(everything else)`
 * is zero for any period. Rearranged: `closing − opening = netChangeMinor −
 * needsReviewMinor`. `openingCashMinor`/`closingCashMinor` are read
 * independently (never derived from the rows), so a database that does not
 * balance shows itself here exactly the way `balances` does on the Balance
 * Sheet and `ties` does on the retired Funds Flow panel.
