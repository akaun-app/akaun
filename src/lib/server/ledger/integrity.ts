 * The whole-books check: does every record's two sides still cancel out, and do
 * they cancel out across the entire table?
 *
 * `entry-builder.ts` is the only writer and enforces these rules on the way in,
 * so a failure here means something got past it — a hand-edited database, a
 * half-applied upgrade, a movement whose record was deleted without it. That is
 * exactly the kind of wrong that is silent, which is why there is a button for
 * it (FR-003, SC-002).
 *
 * Pure arithmetic over rows an aggregate query already reduced, so the sweep is
 * two indexed aggregates and a loop rather than a scan of every movement.
