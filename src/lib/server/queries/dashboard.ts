 * streaming / Promise.all would not help — doing less work is the win.)
 *
 * Every figure is the sum of `ledger_movements.amount_minor` over a window of
 * record dates — the same rows, and the same arithmetic, the profit and loss
 * runs (FR-031). Because a category is an account (FR-006a), "income" and
 * "expenses" here mean the movements on income-category and expense-category
 * accounts, so money moved between two places the business holds touches
 * neither and can never show up as either (FR-007).
 *
 * Movement amounts are whole cents, positive when value goes into the account.
 * Income therefore accumulates negative and is turned the right way up by
 * `displaySign`, in the same one place every report uses (D-03). The figures
 * leave here in whole currency units, which is what the dashboard formats.
