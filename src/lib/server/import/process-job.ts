/**
 * Reads one queued document and leaves it ready for review, or failed with a
 * reason.
 *
 * A document is read one of two ways, by what the uploader chose under "Read
 * as" (006 FR-001):
 *
 * - **As a receipt or invoice** (the standard reading, and Auto-detect while
 *   no profile exists): one record, on the queue row itself, exactly as every
 *   document was read before 006 (FR-003, FR-004).
 * - **As a document with several items**: one proposed record per item. One
 *   item is reviewed as a receipt, on the queue row (FR-009). Several become a
 *   group: the items go into `import_items` and the queue row is marked
 *   Grouped. No item is saved unless all of them are (FR-011).
 * - **With an import profile** the user saved (006 US6-7): read the same way
 *   as several items, with the profile's sections, fee types and instructions
 *   in place of the built-in ones. A copy of the profile is kept on the row,
 *   so a later edit or delete never changes what was read (FR-038).
 * - **Auto-detect** (006 US9): with no enabled profile, the receipt reading
 *   above, unchanged. Otherwise `profile-detect.ts` decides first, and the
 *   document is read with the profile it found or as a receipt (FR-039,
 *   FR-040). The row keeps "auto" as what the uploader chose; `read_how`,
 *   `profile_id` and the copy of the profile say how it was read.
 * - **In the profile's mode** (006 FR-002, FR-032): a profile is read in its
 *   own import mode, Summary lines or Every transaction, whether it was
 *   chosen or detected, and the row stores that mode.
 * - **From its columns** (006 FR-055, FR-057): a spreadsheet read with a
 *   profile whose sections have row rules has its table read by code
 *   (`table-reader.ts`). When every section has them there is no AI call and
 *   no provider is needed, so the check for one is made only where the AI is
 *   asked. Otherwise the AI reads the other sections from the rest of the
 *   sheet, with the table's rows left out of its text. A PDF or a photo read
 *   with such a profile fails: it has no cells.
 * - **In pieces** (006 FR-043): a profile reading in Every transaction mode
 *   that the AI reads, from a PDF or the part of a spreadsheet beside its
 *   table, is read a run of lines at a time (`piece-reader.ts`). The queue row counts the
 *   pieces in `progress_done` / `progress_total` while it is read.
 *
 * The worker calls this with the app's database and storage folder; the tests
 * call it with their own, so nothing here reaches for either.
