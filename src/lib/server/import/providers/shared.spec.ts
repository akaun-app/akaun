        name) — the vendor for an expense, the payer/customer for income — regardless of expense or
        income. Never shortened, abbreviated, or paraphrased. It is used to match against saved
        contacts, so an altered name will fail to match even when the party is already known.

        items or a long description, summarize or shorten it rather than copying it verbatim (aim for
        under 60 characters).
      - date must be YYYY-MM-DD format. If unclear, use today (2026-08-24).
      - amount must be a positive number (no currency symbol).

      - If a field cannot be determined, use an empty string or 0 for amount.
      Description style policy v1 (applies to item_name):
      - Use a short noun phrase describing the goods, service or purpose, in sentence case.
      - Use consistent terminology for equivalent goods and services. Preserve product names and meaningful models.
      - Use English unless the user's additional guidance requests another language.
      - Keep a service period only when the document explicitly supports it; never infer it from the transaction date.
      - Avoid redundant supplier names, amounts, payment methods and receipt numbers stored in separate fields, unless needed to identify the item.
