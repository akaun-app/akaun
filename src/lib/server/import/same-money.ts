/**
 * The overlap guard (006 FR-066): a note on an item that may describe money
 * another document already brought into the books.
 *
 * A marketplace's wallet report lists every order paid into the wallet, and
 * the same marketplace's income statement sums the same sales in its
 * summary. Importing both counts the sales twice. A section can name the
 * profiles whose records describe the same money (`sameMoneyAs`), and an
 * income or expense item of that section gets a review note when records made
 * with one of them already cover its month. The note holds the item back from
 * "Confirm all" until the reviewer has looked, as any review note does.
 *
 * **Why the month, not the day.** A summary's records all carry one date, the
 * statement's, while the wallet report's rows carry the day of each order, so
 * the two never share a day even when they hold the same sales. Marketplace
 * statements are monthly, so the month is the period they cover.
 *
 * Only records that exist count: a document read but not yet confirmed has
 * made none, and a record deleted since is gone. Transfers are never noted
 * (FR-066): moving money to the bank repeats no sale.
 *
 * **Where the profile of a record is kept.** Confirming an item writes the
 * profile it was read with to `import_record_profiles` (`rememberProfile`).
 * The queue row and its items say the same, but clearing the import history
 * deletes them while the records stay, and the guard would then see no
 * records at all. They are still asked, for records confirmed before that
 * table existed.
