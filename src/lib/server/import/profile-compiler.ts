/**
 * Turns a description of what to read from a document (a reading profile) into
 * the two things a reading needs:
 *
 * 1. The JSON Schema sent to the model, which fixes the shape of its answer.
 * 2. A check of the answer against that same shape, which is what the reading
 *    trusts. It drops keys the schema does not name, because Google's models
 *    ignore `additionalProperties: false` and may add their own.
 *
 * Both come from one model of the fields (`FieldSpec`), so they cannot drift
 * apart. The schema only fixes the shape. Which lines the model picks is
 * guidance (the descriptions and the prompt), and the arithmetic is done in
 * code afterwards (`document-reader.ts`), never by the model.
 *
 * The schema keeps to what every provider accepts: every property is required,
 * a value that may be missing is typed `[T, "null"]`, objects set
 * `additionalProperties: false`, and enums hold strings only. It never uses
 * minimum/maximum, pattern, $ref or anyOf. A list of choices that may be empty
 * is the one exception to `[T, "null"]`: it is sent as a plain string whose
 * enum also holds `NONE_VALUE`, and the check reads that back as null (see
 * `toWireSchema`).
 *
 * "Document with several items" is the one built-in profile (below). A saved
 * import profile (006 S2) is compiled the same way: `savedReadingProfile`
 * turns the form the user filled in into another `ReadingProfile`, with its own
 * sections and a schema id of its own, and from there both take one path.

- Never list a subtotal, a total, an amount due, a balance or a balance brought forward, or any

- When a section lists fee types, give each line the fee type it is. When a line is none of them,
  set its fee_type to "${NONE_VALUE}": never choose the closest type for a line that is not one.
- An extra field the line does not print is null (or "${NONE_VALUE}" for a field with a list of
  choices). Never make up a value for it.
- Every item shares the document's other party, date, reference and currency, given once in the
  header. Give an item its own date or reference only when its line prints one of its own.
- Copy every amount exactly as printed, with its sign. Never add up, subtract or work out a figure
