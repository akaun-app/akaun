/**
 * Whether a document may be read again from the same file, and if not, why
 * (006 FR-023, US9 AS6-7).
 *
 * "Read again" throws away what the last reading proposed and reads the file
 * once more, the way the user now names. That is safe only while nothing the
 * last reading proposed has become a record:
 *
 * - a receipt or invoice still waiting for review (one card, no items);
 * - a group none of whose items is confirmed yet (skipped items are fine:
 *   they made nothing, and the new reading replaces them too);
 * - a document whose reading failed;
 * - a skipped document that made no record, while its file is still stored.
 *   Skipping a document releases its file when nothing else uses it, and a
 *   file that is gone cannot be read; the user must upload it again.
 *
 * Every other state is refused with a sentence the screen shows as it is.
 * The rule is written once, here: the job's live update carries its answer
 * (see `jobForEvent`), so no screen needs a copy, and the route asks the same
 * function again inside its write, with the counts as they are then.
