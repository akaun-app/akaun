/**
 * Whether a transfer read off a document is already in the books (006
 * FR-060).
 *
 * A withdrawal from a marketplace wallet to the bank is often recorded before
 * the wallet report is imported: in Reconciliation, when the bank statement
 * shows the money arriving (`createTransferForLine`), or by hand. The receipt
 * duplicate check (`duplicate-detector.ts`) compares a document with expenses
 * and incomes by their wording and other party, and a transfer has neither, so
 * a transfer is compared on what it is instead: the same amount, between the
 * same two accounts, the same way round, within seven days.
 *
 * The way round matters. A transfer out of the wallet to the bank is matched
 * only by an existing transfer from the wallet to the bank, never by one from
 * the bank into the wallet: that is money going back, a different event.
 *
 * One existing transfer flags at most one item of a reading. A report that
 * lists two withdrawals of the same amount a few days apart, of which only one
 * is in the books, must leave the other one ready: it is a real transfer that
 * is not recorded yet. The pairing flags as many items as it can, and within
 * that prefers the nearest date.
