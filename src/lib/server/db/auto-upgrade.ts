/**
 * The conversion an installation runs on itself, with no command and no setting.

 * 002 FR-037: "The update MUST complete with no manual step for a self-hosting
 * user, and MUST be safe to run more than once." This was a command for one
 * release — `scripts/migrate-chart-of-accounts.ts` — and a command is a manual
 * step. Worse, the two states it existed for are the two an installation cannot
 * recover from by itself: a book still on migration 0005 cannot start the server
 * at all, because `legacy-drop-guard` refuses rather than let 0015 destroy the
 * records; and a book already converted to double-entry but never standardized
 * starts happily with every `accounts.type` and `accounts.code` null and no
 * saved defaults, and nothing says so.
 *
 * **Nothing here mutates the supplied database.** The whole conversion runs
 * against a consolidated copy in a temporary directory beside it, and the copy is
 * moved into place only after the legacy conversion, the chart standardization,
 * the foreign-key check and the invariant comparison have all passed. The
 * original family is moved aside into a timestamped directory rather than
 * deleted, so the previous data stays recoverable (002 FR-038). A failure at any
 * point removes the temporary copy and leaves the original byte-identical.
