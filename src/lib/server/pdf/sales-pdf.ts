 *
 * The ledger keeps whole cents of the main currency, so `outstandingMinor` is
 * MYR cents on a USD invoice. Printing it beside "USD" would be wrong, so it is
 * taken back through the invoice's rate. When nothing has been paid the total
 * is used as it is, so an unpaid invoice — and every invoice at rate 1 — prints
 * exactly what its lines add up to, with no trip through the rate at all.
 *
 * A draft owes nothing yet, but its copy is a preview of what it will ask for,
 * so it shows the whole total as due. A cancelled one owes nothing and asks for
 * nothing.
