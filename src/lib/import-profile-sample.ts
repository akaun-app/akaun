/**
 * Building an import profile's table from a sample spreadsheet, and sorting
 * the table's rows into sections by one column's values (006 FR-053, FR-054).
 *
 * The editor sends a sample to `/api/import/profiles/sample`, which reads it
 * and stores nothing (`server/import/sample-inspect.ts`), and gets back a
 * `SampleInspection`: where the table is, its first rows, each column's
 * values, and a guess at what each column holds. The helpers here turn that
 * into the form's layout, and let the editor:
 *
 * - give a column a role (Date, Amount, ...) by its heading, a role being
 *   held by one column at a time (`setColumnRole`);
 * - sort rows into sections by the values of one column, the shape nearly
 *   every row rule takes ("Transaction Type is Withdrawal"), rather than
 *   building conditions (`sortingOf`, `applySorting`).
 *
 * Pure TypeScript with no server imports, so the editor and the specs read
 * the same rules. Nothing here changes what a profile saves: the layout and
 * the row rules are the ones the shared check reads.
