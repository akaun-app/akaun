// already worked out, so the two cannot drift on the figures. Keep the labels in
// step with StatusBadge's `byLabel` map (CLAUDE.md § Gotchas).

 * agrees it has. A record can be paid and not yet cleared, or cleared and still
 * partly owed.
 *
 * No arithmetic here either. `cleared` is computed by
 * src/lib/server/ledger/coverage.ts and travels with the record, so this only
 * names what the server already worked out (FR-056).
