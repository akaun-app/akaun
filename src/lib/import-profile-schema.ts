/**
 * Import profiles: a saved way of reading one kind of document (006 US6-7,
 * FR-030 to FR-038).
 *
 * A user fills in a form: the profile's name, how to recognise it, its
 * instructions, and its sections. Each section has a kind (income, expense or
 * by sign), an optional fixed category, and an optional closed list of fee
 * types, each optionally pinned to a category. The server turns this into the
 * JSON Schema sent to the model; the user never edits that schema. The one
 * place raw JSON is allowed is "Advanced: extra fields", a small JSON Schema
 * fragment of plain values per section (FR-035).
 *
 * This file is the one check of a profile. The editor runs it as the user
 * types and the server runs it again before anything is saved, so the two can
 * never disagree about what is allowed (the `sequence-template.ts` pattern).
 * It has no imports from `$lib/server` and does not use zod, because client
 * files do not load zod.
 *
 * A profile may also carry a table layout, and its sections row rules, for
 * reading a spreadsheet from its columns with no AI (FR-053 to FR-055). Every
 * column they name is one of the layout's headings, checked here too.
 *
 * Every problem is reported with the path of the value it is about, such as
 * `sections[1].feeTypes[3].key`, so the editor can show it next to the field,
 * and with a plain sentence saying what is wrong.
